  <summary>omniIDL/C++ backend generated incorrect DynSK.cc typecode
  data for some interfaces.</summary>

  <reported>dme</reported>

  <text>Incorrect typecode data was generated for some interfaces eg:
  <pre>
  interface I{
    typedef sequence&lt;I&gt; t_I;
  };
  </pre>

  <summary>If the remote server is not present, a CORBA call on win32
  platforms blocks for 30 seconds before raising a COMM_FAILURE exception.
  </summary>

  <reported>sll</reported>

  <text>
  <p> The ORB uses a select() after the connect() call. Win32 differs from
  other platforms in that it reports a connect() failure to the select()
  via the exception fd_set. This was not tested by the ORB.

  <summary>-ORBpoa_iiop_port overrides OMNIORB_USEHOSTNAME</summary>

  <reported>Beat Meier</reported>

  <text>
  -ORBpoa_iiop_port would override the OMNIORB_USEHOSTNAME environment
  variable, meaning that -ORBpoa_iiop_name_port had to be used.

  <summary>CORBA calls with large arguments on Win32 platforms may fail
  because tcp socket was wrongly left in non-blocking state.
  </summary>

  <reported>chm</reported>

  <text>
  <p>The connect code in 3.0.0 now turns the socket to non-blocking
  and set a limit on the time it prepares to wait. Once connected, the
  socket is turned back to blocking. Unfortunately, the ioctlsocket
  call is passed the wrong argument which leaves the socket in
  non-blocking state. The end result is that for CORBA calls with
  large arguments, the call may fail mysteriously (because windows
  says the send call would block and the ORB thinks it is wrong
  because it thinks the socket is blocking).</p>

  <summary>omniIDL/C++ generated method signature mismatch when using

  <text>omniIDL generated a method prototype in the .hh file which didn't
  match up with the implementation in the SK.cc file due to a variable
  name typo in the C++ backend.</text>

  <summary>Support for object references with unlikely repository
  ids.</summary>

  <reported>chm</reported>

  <text>
  <p>In the case that omniORB receives an object reference claiming to
  be type "A", and it requires type "B", but it has static knowledge
  that "A" is not derived from "B", it rejects the object reference.
  This is incorrect, since the object may actually have type "C",
  which is derived from both "A" and "B".</p>

  <p>A special case of this is an object reference claiming to be a
  base type of the target type (such as CORBA::Object). Attempts to
  narrow such a reference would always fail.</p>

  <summary>Thread tracing accidentally left on</summary>
  <text>
  <p>Tracing of mutexes and condition variables was accidentally left
  turned on in include/omniORB3/tracedthread.h. Turning it off gives a
  significant performance improvement, especially for local calls.</p>

  <p>All omniORB libraries need to be rebuilt to make this change; the
  make rules should do this automatically. The libraries remain
  compatible with user code, so it does not need to be recompiled. If
  you have omniORBpy installed, you must also recompile that.
  Unfortunately, its make rules do not realise that a recompile is
  necessary (I don't know why), so you must explicitly "<code>make
  clean</code>" before "<code>make export</code>".</p>

  <summary>omniidl name look-up is more strict</summary>

  When looking-up a name, omniidl now raises an error if a name which
  differs only in case is found along the look-up path. Before, it
