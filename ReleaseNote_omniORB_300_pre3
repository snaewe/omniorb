Release Notes for omniORB 3.0.0 pre3  (28 Jun 2000)
====================================

For all intents and purposes, this is the release candidate for
omniORB 3.0.0. This version has been tested on x86 Linux, Windows
NT/2000, Solaris 2.5.1, Irix 6.5, HPUX 11.00. The purpose of producing
this pre-release is to give our users a chance to check if there are
any build problems remaining before we release 3.0.0. So please give
it a try and report any build problems ASAP.

The last release was 2.8.0 (31st August 1999).

Source code is available via anonymous CVS.  Please see:

      http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/omniORB.html
      http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/cvs.html


If you have an existing build of omniORB 3, you must "make veryclean"
or remove the tree and start again.

NOTE the new section about omniidl and Python below.


Introduction
------------

This version of omniORB incorporates a major re-write of the core runtime.
Key features include:

  o  support for the Portable Object Adapter (POA)
  o  support for the Interoperable Naming Service (INS)
  o  new IDL compiler
  o  identical semantics for local and remote object invocations
  o  location forwarding into and outof the local address space
  o  new dynamically growing object table (improves performance
      for applications with large numbers of objects)
  o  legacy support for the BOA (including using both BOA and POA
      together in the same process)
  o  improved message logging, including logging application
      level requests and throwing of system exceptions
  o  lots of other stuff


Changes since 3.0.0 pre 2
-------------------------

1. Support for the Interoperable Naming Service. See chapter 4 of the
   omniORB manual for details.

2. Added new omniIDL/C++ compiler backend flags & features:

    -Wbd=suffix      : changes the DynSK.cc file suffix
    -Wbkeep_inc_path : Preserves IDL #include path in generated C++ header
    -Wbuse_quotes    : Uses "" rather than <> in C++ header #includes

   Use 'omniidl -bcxx -u' to get the full list of command line options.

3. Updated user manual

4. Runtime thread debugging trace has been disabled. This results in a
   noticeable performance improvement, especially in same address space
   calls. (from 21usec to 6usec on Linux x86 PII 300).

5. Fixed assignment to an element of a sequence of string and a sequence of
   object reference. Previous version does not work if the compiler
   does not do the obvious optimisation. Only DEC v5.6 C++ compiler is known
   to be affected by this bug.

6. Client side call timeout now works on Windows NT and HPUX 11.00.

7. COMM_FAILURE exception propagated from the server side will be reported
   as an exception to the application. This allows the invocation
   code to distinguish between transport problems and COMM_FAILURE
   propagated from the server side.

8. Update omkdepend and the various win32 wrappers for Cygwin's new
   "mounts v2" registry subtree.  Old Gnuwin32 mounts should still work.

9. Merged OpenVMS port

10. Lots of other minor changes and bug fixes. Refer to the <top>/update.log
    file for details.


Changes since 3.0.0 pre 1
------------------------------

1. New IDL compiler

   omniidl3 has been replaced by a new general-purpose IDL compiler
   simply named omniidl. This has several important consequences:

    o omniidl requires Python 1.5.2 to build and run. We recommend
      that you use a full Python installation, but we have made
      minimal binary versions for Windows, Solaris and Linux available
      at:

         ftp://ftp.uk.research.att.com/pub/omniORB/python/

      You must point the makefiles to your Python installation. See
      README.unix or README.win32 for details.

    o omniidl aims for strict compliance to the IDL specification.
      You may find that some IDL which used to pass omniidl3 now has
      compilation errors.

    o omniidl's command-line flags are different. Where before you
      said

        omniidl3 echo.idl

      to generate the basic stubs and skeletons, you must now say

        omniidl -bcxx echo.idl

      (The -bcxx tells the compiler to use the C++ back-end. If you
      have omniORBpy installed, you can also say -bpython to generate
      Python stubs.)

      The following table shows how omniidl3's flags have changed. You
      can get a list of all omniidl's flags with omniidl -bcxx -u.

      omniidl3 flag    omniidl flag    Meaning

      -Dname[=value]   -Dname[=value]  Define name for preprocessor
      -Uname           -Uname          Undefine name for preprocessor
      -E               -E              Run preprocessor only
      -Idir            -Idir           Include dir in preprocessor search
      -Ycmd            -Ycmd           Command to run for preprocessor
      -a               -Wba            Generate code for Typecode and any
      -h suffix        -Wbh=suffix     Specify suffix for generated headers
      -s suffix        -Wbs=suffix     Specify suffix for generated stubs
      -tp              -Wbtp           Generate tie implementation skeletons
      -tf              -Wbtf           Generate flattened tie skeletons
      -F               -WbF            Generate code fragments (experts only)
      -Bboa            -WbBOA          Generate BOA compatible skeletons
      -Bold_signatures -Wbold          Use CORBA 2.1 signatures
      -Bold_reserved_prefix
                       -Wbold_prefix   Prefix C++ reserved words with _

      -u               -u              Print usage information
      -v               -v              Trace compilation stages


    o If you move omniidl out of the omniORB tree, it may be unable to
      find Python files which it requires. In this case, either use
      the -p flag to give the full path to the lib/python directory,
      or set the PYTHONPATH environment variable to contain that
      location.

    o The make rules for omniidl have not been tested on all platforms
      (since we don't have access to them). If you encounter build
      difficulties on your platform, please look at
      src/tool/omniidl/cxx/dir.mk to see if it is obvious how to fix
      it.



Changes since 2.8.0
-------------------

1. The POA.

   Exists!

   The following features are not implemented:

     o  PortableServer::Current
     o  DSI is incomplete (depends on Current).


2. IDL stubs.

   There are a number of improvements.  You may find that the size of the
   stub code generated is smaller.

   The stubs must be regenerated with the new IDL compiler to be compatible
   with the runtime library.

   The current shared runtime library versions are:

   On various unices:

       libomniORB3.so ---> libomniORB3.so.0 --> libomniORB3.so.0.0

   On IBM AIX

       libomniORB30.a
       libomniDynamic30.a

   On Windows NT/95, the omniORB runtime DLLs for this version are:

       libomniORB300_rt.dll
       libomniORB300_rt.lib
       libomniDynamic300_rt.dll
       libomniDynamic300_rt.lib

   Make sure you update your Visual Studio to pick up the right library.


3. New command line options and ORB configuration variables:

    -ORBtraceInvocations
    omniORB::traceInvocations
      enable tracing of invocations of CORBA objects.

    -ORBpoa_iiop_port <port number>
      tells the POA the port number to use.

    -ORBpoa_iiop_name_port <hostname[:port number]>
      tells the POA the hostname and optionally the port number to use.

      NB. The BOA and POA will both use the same port if used together.

    omniORB::objectTableSize

      The default value is zero, and indicates that omniORB should grow
      the object table as necassary.  It is recommended that you use
      this facility.

      Setting another value sets a fixed size for the object table,
      thus eliminating the overhead of resizing the table if you
      know in advance the likely number of objects.  Since an open
      hsah table is used, performance does not suffer disasterously
      if this number of objects is exceeded.

      If set, this value must be modified before calling CORBA::ORB_init().

    omniORB::poaHoldRequestTimeout

      If a POA is in the HOLDING state, then this value gives the number
      of seconds after which the POA will timeout and throw a TRANSIENT
      exception to the client (if the POA is not transitioned to
      another state).

      The default is zero, which indicates no timeout.


4. New mapping for signatures of operations in skeletons.

    The mapping for the arguments to operations in implementation
    skeletons changed in the spec between versions 2.1 and 2.2.
    You are now required to use T_out types (where applicable) for
    'out' arguments.

    This may mean that you have to modify your object implementations.
    However the old signatures can still be used by passing the
    -Bold_signatures flag to omniidl3.


5. New omniidl3 flags:

    -t has been replaced by two new options:

      -tp              - produce tie implementation skeletons
      -tf              - generate flattened tie implementation skeletons

    The latter is needed if on your platform modules are mapped to
    c++ classes, and your compiler does not support template members
    of classes.

    -Bboa              - generate BOA skeletons (_sk_foo).  By default
                         only POA skeletons are generated.

    To generate the old-style (BOA compatible) tie skeletons you
    must supply both the -b and -tf flags.

    -Bold_signatures   - use pre CORBA 2.2 mapping for skeleton operation
                         signatures.


6. The member function CORBA::ORB::NP_destroy() is deprecated.  Use
   CORBA::ORB::destroy() instead.


7. Location Forwarding.

    A new omniORB specific exception omniORB::LOCATION_FORWARD is
    included.  This may be thrown from an object implementation to
    indicate to the client that the request should be re-directed
    to another object.

    For portability you are better off using
    PortableServer::ForwardRequest within a ServantManager.
    However omniORB::LOCATION_FORWARD is more flexible, since it
    can be thrown from any object implementation.

    See include/omniORB3/omniORB.h


8. Logging and omniORB::traceLevel.

    All omniORB log messages are now prefixed with 'omniORB:' to make
    it easy to separate omniORB messages from other messages that
    might be generated by an application.

    omniORB log messages are now emitted atomically (wrt fprintf()),
    which ensures that parts of omniORB log messages will never be
    interleaved.

    A new logging class is used internally for generating log messages,
    omniORB::log.  This may be useful for generating messages in
    application programs.  In this case a different prefix from the
    default can be specified.

    It is possible for the ORB to emit a log message each time a
    CORBA operation is invoked on a local or remote object.  See the
    section on command line options and configuration variables.

    A log message is now written whenever a system exception is thrown
    from the omniORB runtime.  For example:

      omniORB: throw COMM_FAILURE from tcpSocketMTfactory.cc:909

    This is enabled if the omniORB::traceLevel is 10 or greater.


9. Examples.

    The standard echo examples have been updated to use the POA.
    There is a 'boa' directory which uses the old-style BOA interface.
    There is also a 'poa' directory which isn't very exciting yet,
    but will soon have a few more samples of POA code.


10. omniNames.

    This has been updated to use the POA.  Unfortunately the format of
    the log file has changed slightly.  Eventually we may write a utility
    to convert the log file to the new format.  But for now if this is a
    problem for you, then please continue to use an older version.


11. The omniORB user guide has *not* been updated :(


12. Things that don't work.

    a) The PortableServer::Current interface is not supported.  Any
       behaviour depending per-thread context information is not
       supported.

    b) The DSI interface has changed significantly.  Old code will
       have to be re-written to the new interface.  There is no
       support for using the DSI with the BOA.
        This part of the ORB is incomplete, since it depends in
       part on PortableServer::Current.  See the example in
       src/examples/dsi for a way to workaround this problem for
       now.

    c) The Lifecycle service has not yet been re-implemented.

    d) The name of tie implementation skeletons has changed (in line
       with the POA mapping).
