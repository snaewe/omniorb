  <summary>Bug with multiply-recursive TypeCode</summary>
  <reported>Walter Stroebel</reported>
  <text>
  A recursive type in which more than one member recursed to the same
  type could cause an infinite recursion, leading to a stack overflow.

  <summary>On Digital Unix/Tru64, gethostbyname_r() is not used properly</summary>
  <reported>Neeraj Bhatia</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-05/0064.html"/>

  <summary>Invalid object references handled incorrectly</summary>
  <reported>Nick Belshaw</reported>
  <text>
  An IOR containing no recognised profiles (e.g. from ORBit with
  default settings) would be treated as nil by string_to_object, and a
  MARSHAL exception by the unmarshalling code. The correct exception
  is INV_OBJREF.

  <summary>System exceptions not forwarded from incarnate() and preinvoke()</summary>
  <reported>Chris Newbold</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-11/0083.html"/>
  <text>
  System exceptions thrown from a ServantLocator's preinvoke() method, or a
  ServantActivator's incarnate() method are silently converted into an
  OBJ_ADAPTER exception.  They should be passed on to the client without
  change.

  <summary>Examples fail to build with nmake on Windows 9x</summary>
  <text>
  As explained in 3.0.1's <a href="bug301.html#bug9">bug 9</a>, some
  Windows 98 machines (but not all) fail to cope with the pipe between
  the C pre-processor and omniidl. The work-around is to use the -T
  flag. The dir.mak files in the examples now use this flag.

  <summary>omniidl system dependency clean-up</summary>
  <text>
  Not really a bug, but some long-standing ugliness in omniidl's
  system dependencies has been cleaned up. It's listed here because
  any code which uses omniidl's C++ interface may need to be slightly
  modified.

  <summary>omniIDL/C++ backend tie template operation mapping error</summary>
  <reported>Chris Newbold</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-10/0071.html"/>
  <text>
  The tie template code used the _objref argument mapping rather than the 
  _impl mapping.

  <summary>Race condition in POA triggers assertion failure</summary>
  <reported>Chris Newbold</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-10/0055.html"/>
  <text>
  There is a race condition in the POA between deactivating an object
  and it being etherealised, which can trigger an assertion failure
  (which in turn throws an omniORB::fatalException()).

  <summary>C++ back-end claims that it does not support long long</summary>
  <reported>Chris Knight</reported>
  <text>
  A new check added to the C++ back-end incorrectly reported that long
  long is not supported, even though it is. Note that long long is not
  currently supported in Any.
