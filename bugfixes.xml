<bug id="8" date="Wed Sep  6 12:13:30 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>Support for Python 1.6 and 2.0b1</summary>
  <text>
  omniidl was hard-coded to require Python 1.5.2, just in case later
  versions were incompatible. 1.6 and 2.0b1 are compatible, so they
  are now supported.

<bug id="7" date="Mon Sep  4 10:02:41 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>#includes of iostream.h left in omniORB headers</summary>
  <reported>Paul Nader</reported>
  <text>
  Several files had <code>#include&lt;iostream.h&gt;</code> left
  behind from debugging. This causes problems for code which does
  <code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</code> without the <code>.h</code>.

  <summary>BOA constructor with object key broken</summary>
  <reported>Paul Nader</reported>
  <text>
  The fix to <a href="bug300.html#bug8">bug 8</a> in omniORB 3.0.0 did
  not actually work.

<bug id="5" date="Fri Aug 25 14:25:20 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>omniidl loses all but the first comment with -K</summary>
  <reported>Richard Gruet</reported>
  <text>
  On some platforms, omniidl -K would lose all but the first comment
  attached to a node. The code used a construct whose evaluation order
  is undefined in C++, so it worked with some compilers, but not
  others.

<bug id="4" date="Wed Aug 23 16:44:36 BST 2000" user="djs">

  <summary>MSVC5/6 marshalling multidimensional arrays of basic types</summary>
  <reported>dme</reported>
  <text>MSVC5/6 fail to resolve the correct operator[] when marshalling
        a multidimensional array of basic types, only in the return case
        (not when using an out type)
  </text>

<bug id="3" date="Tue Aug 22 15:48:11 BST 2000" user="sll">

  <summary>"Unexpected" exception at initialization</summary>
  <reported>Chris Newbold</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-08/0066.html"/>
  <text>When the port specified via -ORBpoa_iiop_port happens to be in use,
        an internal omniORB exception is raised by resolve_initial_reference().
        Now a system exception CORBA::INITIALIZE is raised instead.

<bug id="2" date="Tue Aug 22 10:59:21 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>Missing make rules for GCC on Solaris</summary>
  <reported>Mark Borges</reported>
  <link href="http://www.uk.research.att.com/omniORB/archives/2000-08/0170.html"/>
  <text>Make rules for the omniDynamic shared library were missing, so
  the new libCOS failed to link.</text>
</bug>


<bug id="1" date="Mon Aug 21 10:11:51 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>Typo in omniidl.idltype.Declared.name()</summary>

  <reported>Richard Gruet</reported>

  <text>
  The <code>name()</code> function of <code>idltype.Declared</code>
  accidentally returned a list containing a single string rather than
  just the string itself.
