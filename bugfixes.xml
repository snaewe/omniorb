  <summary>Support for object references with unlikely repository
  ids.</summary>

  <reported>chm</reported>

  <text>
  <p>In the case that omniORB receives an object reference claiming to
  be type "A", and it requires type "B", but it has static knowledge
  that "A" is not derived from "B", it rejects the object reference.
  This is incorrect, since the object may actually have type "C",
  which is derived from both "A" and "B".</p>

  <p>A special case of this is an object reference claiming to be a
  base type of the target type (such as CORBA::Object). Attempts to
  narrow such a reference would always fail.</p>

<bug id="5" date="Wed Jul 19 18:03:11 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>Thread tracing accidentally left on</summary>
  <text>
  <p>Tracing of mutexes and condition variables was accidentally left
  turned on in include/omniORB3/tracedthread.h. Turning it off gives a
  significant performance improvement, especially for local calls.</p>

  <p>All omniORB libraries need to be rebuilt to make this change; the
  make rules should do this automatically. The libraries remain
  compatible with user code, so it does not need to be recompiled. If
  you have omniORBpy installed, you must also recompile that.
  Unfortunately, its make rules do not realise that a recompile is
  necessary (I don't know why), so you must explicitly "<code>make
  clean</code>" before "<code>make export</code>".</p>

<bug id="4" date="Wed Jul 19 17:22:34 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>omniidl name look-up is more strict</summary>
  <text>
  When looking-up a name, omniidl now raises an error if a name which
  differs only in case is found along the look-up path. Before, it
  would ignore the name and continue until an exact match was found.

<bug id="3" date="Mon Jul 17 15:20:18 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>OpenVMS patches from Bruce Visscher</summary>
  <text>
  <p>This adds some missing makefiles for a directory that contains
  tools for building shareable images on the VAX platform. Also, some
  minor problems with the build of omniORBpy were fixed.</p>

  <p><em>Note:</em> This update is only available through CVS or the
  FTP snapshots, not via the patch file.</p>
