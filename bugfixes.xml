  <summary>CORBA calls with large arguments on Win32 platforms may fail
  because tcp socket was wrongly left in non-blocking state.
  </summary>

  <reported>chm</reported>

  <text>
  <p> The connect code in 3.0.0 now turns the socket to non-blocking and set a
limit on the time it prepares to wait. Once connected, the socket is
turned back to blocking. Unfortunately, the ioctlsocket call is passed the
wrong argument which leaves the socket in non-blocking state. The end
result is that for CORBA calls with large arguments, the call may fail
mysteriously (because windows says the send call would block and the ORB
thinks it is wrong because it thinks the socket is blocking).</p>

  <summary>Fix to bug 4 broke escaped identifiers</summary>

  between the escaped identifier and the target.</text>

  <summary>omniidl bug with inheriting typedef to forward declared

  The following IDL is valid, but omniidl flagged it as an error:

    typedef I J;
    interface I {};

<bug id="7" date="Fri Jul 21 16:20:43 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>Support for object references with unlikely repository
  ids.</summary>

  <reported>chm</reported>

  <text>
  <p>In the case that omniORB receives an object reference claiming to
  be type "A", and it requires type "B", but it has static knowledge
  that "A" is not derived from "B", it rejects the object reference.
  This is incorrect, since the object may actually have type "C",
  which is derived from both "A" and "B".</p>

  <p>A special case of this is an object reference claiming to be a
  base type of the target type (such as CORBA::Object). Attempts to
  narrow such a reference would always fail.</p>

<bug id="5" date="Wed Jul 19 18:03:11 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>Thread tracing accidentally left on</summary>
  <text>
  <p>Tracing of mutexes and condition variables was accidentally left
  turned on in include/omniORB3/tracedthread.h. Turning it off gives a
  significant performance improvement, especially for local calls.</p>

  <p>All omniORB libraries need to be rebuilt to make this change; the
  make rules should do this automatically. The libraries remain
  compatible with user code, so it does not need to be recompiled. If
  you have omniORBpy installed, you must also recompile that.
  Unfortunately, its make rules do not realise that a recompile is
  necessary (I don't know why), so you must explicitly "<code>make
  clean</code>" before "<code>make export</code>".</p>

<bug id="4" date="Wed Jul 19 17:22:34 BST 2000" user="dpg1">

  <summary>omniidl name look-up is more strict</summary>
  <text>
  When looking-up a name, omniidl now raises an error if a name which
  differs only in case is found along the look-up path. Before, it
  would ignore the name and continue until an exact match was found.
