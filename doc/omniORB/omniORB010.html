<A NAME="chap:interceptors"></A>
omniORB 4.0 supports interceptors that allow the application to insert
processing in various points along the call chain, and in various
other locations. It does not support the standard Portable
Interceptors API.<BR>
<BR>
The interceptor interfaces are defined in a single header,
<TT>include/omniORB4/omniInterceptors.h</TT>. Each interception point
consists of a singleton object with <TT>add()</TT> and <TT>remove()</TT> methods,
and the definition of an `interceptor info' class. For example:
<PRE>
class omniInterceptors {
  ...
  class clientSendRequest_T {
  public:

    class info_T {
    public:
      giopStream&amp;              giopstream;
      const omniIOR&amp;           ior;
      const char*              opname;
      CORBA::Boolean           oneway;
      CORBA::Boolean           response_expected;
      IOP::ServiceContextList  service_contexts;

      info_T(giopStream&amp; s, const omniIOR&amp; i, const char* op,
      CORBA::Boolean ow, CORBA::Boolean re) :
 giopstream(s),ior(i),opname(op),oneway(ow),response_expected(re),
 service_contexts(5) {}

    private:
      info_T();
      info_T(const info_T&amp;);
      info_T&amp; operator=(const info_T&amp;);
    };

    typedef CORBA::Boolean (*interceptFunc)(info_T&amp; info);

    void add(interceptFunc);
    void remove(interceptFunc);
  };
  ...
};
</PRE>
You can see that the interceptors themselves are functions
that take the <TT>info_T</TT> object as their argument and return
boolean. Interceptors are called in the order they are registered;
normally, all interceptor functions return true, meaning that
processing should continue with subsequent interceptors. If an
interceptor returns false, later interceptors are not called. You
should only do that if you really know what you are doing.<BR>
<BR>
Notice that the <TT>info_T</TT> contains references to several omniORB
internal data types. The definitions of these can be found in other
header files within <TT>include/omniORB4</TT> and
<TT>include/omniORB4/internal</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc48"></A>
<H2><A NAME="htoc112">10.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Interceptor registration</H2>
All the interceptor singletons are registered within another singleton
object of class <TT>omniInterceptors</TT>. You retrieve a pointer to
that singleton with the <TT>omniORB::getInterceptors()</TT> function,
which must be called after <TT>CORBA::ORB_init()</TT>, but before the ORB
is used. The code to register an interceptor looks, for example, like:
<PRE>
omniInterceptors* interceptors = omniORB::getInterceptors();
interceptors-&gt;clientSendRequest.add(myInterceptorFunc);
</PRE>
<A NAME="toc49"></A>
<H2><A NAME="htoc113">10.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Available interceptors</H2>
The following interceptors are available:
<DL COMPACT=compact><DT><B>encodeIOR</B><DD><BR>
Called when encoding an IOR to represent an object reference. This
interception point allows the application to insert extra profile
components into IORs. Note that you must understand and adhere to the
rules about data stored in IORs, otherwise the IORs created may be
invalid. omniORB itself uses this interceptor to insert various items,
so you can see an example of its use in the
<TT>insertSupportedComponents()</TT> function defined in
<TT>src/lib/omniORB/orbcore/ior.cc</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>decodeIOR</B><DD><BR>
Called when decoding an IOR. The application can use this to get out
whatever information they put into IORs with encodeIOR. Again, see
<TT>extractSupportedComponents()</TT> in
<TT>src/lib/omniORB/orbcore/ior.cc</TT> for an example.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>clientSendRequest</B><DD><BR>
Called just before a request header is sent over the network. The
application can use it to insert service contexts in the header. See
<TT>setCodeSetServiceContext()</TT> in
<TT>src/lib/omniORB/orbcore/cdrStream.cc</TT> for an example of its use.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>clientReceiveReply</B><DD><BR>
Called as the client receives a reply, just after unmarshalling the
reply header. Called for normal replies and exceptions.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>serverReceiveRequest</B><DD><BR>
Called when the server receives a request, just after unmarshalling
the request header. See the <TT>getCodeSetServiceContext()</TT> function in
<TT>src/lib/omniORB/orbcore/cdrStream.cc</TT> for an example.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>serverSendReply</B><DD><BR>
Called just before the server marshals a reply header.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>serverSendException</B><DD><BR>
Called just before the server marshals an exception reply header.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>createIdentity</B><DD><BR>
Called when the ORB is about to create an `identity' object to
represent a CORBA object. It allows application code to provide its
own identity implementations. It is very unlikely that an application
will need to do this.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>createORBServer</B><DD><BR>
Used internally by the ORB to register different kinds of server. At
present, only a GIOP server is registered. It is very unlikely that
application code will need to do this.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>createThread</B><DD><BR>
Called whenever the ORB creates a thread. The <TT>info_T</TT> class for
this interceptor is
<PRE>
    class info_T {
    public:
      virtual void run() = 0;
    };
</PRE>
The interceptor function is called in the context of the newly created
thread. The function <EM>must</EM> call the <TT>info_T</TT>'s <TT>run()</TT>
method, to pass control to the thread body. <TT>run()</TT> returns just
before the thread exits. This arrangement allows the interceptor to
initialise some per-thread state before the thread body runs, then
release it just before the thread exits.<BR>
<BR>
<DT><B>assignUpcallThread</B><DD><BR>
The ORB maintains a general thread pool, from which threads are drawn
for various purposes. One purpose is for performing upcalls to
application code, in response to incoming CORBA calls. The
assignUpcallThread interceptor is called when a thread is assigned to
perform upcalls. In the thread per connection model, the thread stays
assigned to performing upcalls for the entire lifetime of the
underlying network connection; in the thread pool model, threads are
assigned for upcalls on a per call basis, so this interceptor is
triggered for every incoming call<SUP><A NAME="text17" HREF="#note17"><FONT SIZE=2>1</FONT></A></SUP>. As with the
createThread interceptor, the interceptor function must call the
<TT>info_T</TT>'s <TT>run()</TT> method to pass control to the upcall.<BR>
<BR>
When a thread finishes its assignment of processing upcalls, it
returns to the pool (even in thread per connection mode), so the same
thread can be reassigned to perform more upcalls, or reused for a
different purpose.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike the other interceptors, the interceptor functions for
createThread and assignUpcallThread have no return value. Interceptor
chaining is performed by calls through the <TT>info_T::run()</TT> method,
rather than by visiting interceptor functions in turn.</DL>
<HR WIDTH="50%" SIZE=1><DL><DT><A NAME="note17" HREF="#text17"><FONT SIZE=5>1</FONT></A><DD>Except that with the
threadPoolWatchConnection parameter set true, a thread can perform
multiple upcalls even when thread pool mode is active.
