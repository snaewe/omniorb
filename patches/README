This directory contains patches to the source to work around bugs in some
old / broken compilers.

This patch is for VisualAge C++ 5 on AIX. It works-around an inline
function issue, and some build issues.

  aix_xlC_5.0.patch


This patch is for Dec C++ 5.6 on Tru64. It is against omniORB 3.0, so
it will not work with omniORB 4.0. It should give you a hint about
what needs to be done to omniORB 4.0, though. If you successfully
compile omniORB on this platform, please send an up to date patch to
the omniORB mailing list.
