This is a simple example of how to use the SSL transport.

1. Make sure that the ssl transport is built for your platform.
   The ssl transport is built only if the make variable OPEN_SSL_ROOT
   is defined and points to the root directory of the openssl library.
   If you are using the configure script, use the --with-openssl
   configuration option.

   On other platforms, edit the platform makefile to give the right
   location.

   For example, on Windows:

   OPEN_SSL_ROOT = /cygdrive/c/openssl

   OPEN_SSL_CPPFLAGS = -I$(OPEN_SSL_ROOT)/include
   OPEN_SSL_LIB = $(patsubst %,$(LibPathPattern),$(OPEN_SSL_ROOT)/lib) \
                  ssleay32.lib libeay32.lib
   OMNIORB_SSL_LIB += $(OPEN_SSL_LIB)
   OMNIORB_SSL_CPPFLAGS += $(OPEN_SSL_CPPFLAGS)


2. This example should build if you have done step 1.

   Notice the example programs are linked with the SSL transport
   shared library and the openssl library. The make variable,
   OMNIORB_SSL_LIB defines all the necessary libraries for the ssl
   transport. If you are using unix, the SSL transport shared library
   is called:

        libomnisslTP4.so

   To use ssl, you must link the executable with the ssl library. If
   that is done, you must set up a few SSL context parameters before
   calling ORB_init or you will get an INITIALIZE exception. The
   context parameters are explained below.


3. What does this example do?

    a) eg2_impl is the server. On startup it creates a ssl endpoint
       and exports only this endpoint. If you use catior to look at
       its IOR content, you will see something like this:


% catior IOR:010000000d00000049444c3a4563686f3a312e3000000000010000000000000074000000010102000e0000003135382e3132342e36352e33370000000e000000fee63c2a3b00007560000000000000000300000000000000080000000100000000545441010000001c0000000100000001000100010000000100010509010100010000000901010014000000080000000100600060007988

            TAG_ORB_TYPE omniORB
            TAG_CODE_SETS char native code set: ISO-8859-1
                          char conversion code set: UTF-8
                          wchar native code set: UTF-16
                          wchar conversion code set: UTF-16
 
            TAG_SSL_SEC_TRANS port = 34937 supports = 96 requires = 96
 

       TAG_SSL_SEC_TRANS is the component which tells the client ORB
       where the SSL endpoint is. Notice that the ORB does not create
       a plain tcp endpoint as the port number in the IOR is 0. You
       can ask the ORB to create the tcp endpoint as well by
       specifying the argument -ORBendPoint giop:tcp::


    b) eg2_clt is the ssl client, use it to talk to eg2_impl

    c) If you look into the source code, you can see that the
       following are setup before ORB_init is called:

            sslContext::certificate_authority_file = "root.pem";
            sslContext::key_file = "server.pem";
            sslContext::key_file_password = "password";

       Basically, you must tell the ssl transport 2 things:

        i)  The CA's certificate. This is given in the PEM format file
            root.pem.

        ii) Your own private key and certificate. In the example, the
            file server.pem stores the information. The password to
            unlock the key file is "password".

      OpenSSL actually provides you with a lot of options to set up
      keys and certificates etc. To choose different options, you can
      register your own implementation of the sslContext object. See
      include/omniORB4/sslContext.cc for details.

    d) On the server side, you have to tell the ORB, via ORB_init, to
       instantiate a SSL endpoint. This is done using the -ORBendPoint
       option. The example modifies the command line appropriately so
       you do not need to specify it when running eg2_impl.

       e.g. -ORBendPoint giop:ssl::         (let the OS pick a port number) 
            -ORBendPoint giop:ssl::12345    (at port 12345)
            -ORBendPoint giop:ssl:foo:12345 (port 12345 and hostname foo)
