 - Bug fixes.


Changes since omniORB 4.1.0 release candidate 1

   Application code using the interceptor will require a small
   modification.

 - Experimental omniConnectionMgmt extension.

 - Minor bug fixes.


Changes since omniORB 4.1.0 beta 1
----------------------------------

 - IPv6 support.

     See section 8.6.1 of the omniORB manual for details.

 - New endPointPublish parameter.

     Used for configuring what to publish in IORs. See section 8.6.2
     of the omniORB manual.

 - Minor bug fixes.


Changes since omniORB 4.0.x
---------------------------

 - Objects by value support.

     omniORB now supports the full objects by value specification,
     with the exception of custom valuetypes. See chapter 13 of the
     omniORB manual for information about valuetype in omniORB.

 - Abstract interfaces support.

 - New simpler and more efficient Any implementation.

 - New socket collection implementation.

     Uses poll() on platforms where it is available to avoid limiting
     the number of connections to FD_SETSIZE. Windows specific version
     that better manages the unusual Windows fd_set.

 - New tracing options traceTime and traceInvocationReturns.

     See section 4.2 of the omniORB manual.

 - C++ mapping updated to version 1.1.

     Deprecation of RefCountServantBase; Servant_var template type.

 - Support for local interfaces.

     In particular, ServantManagers and AdapterActivators no longer
     need to be activated in a POA, but can be simple C++ objects. See
     the examples in src/examples/poa/servant_manager.

     Note that to use local interfaces derived from unconstrained
     interfaces, you must compile the idl for the base interfaces
     using the -Wbvirtual_objref -Wbimpl_mapping omniidl flags.



Known issues
------------

This release has the following known issues and omissions:

 - valuetypes supporting local interfaces generate invalid C++. This
   is an issue with the standard C++ mapping.
